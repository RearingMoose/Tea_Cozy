# Tea Cozy
## Introduction

This is my first attempt at completing The Tea Cozy excercise through Codeacademy using HTML and CSS.
The project was connected with the flexbox lessons for CSS.
While working through the site, I decided to practive with some hover effects (such as making items/tiles grow) and seeing if I could make a "hamburger" menu that would work on mobile.
